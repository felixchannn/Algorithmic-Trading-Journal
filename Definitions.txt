This page is for definitions required to understand trading models. 

Mean Reversion: 
A strategy based on the concept that the high and low prices of an 
asset are a temporary phenomenon that revert to their mean value periodically.

Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP): 
This strategy breaks up a large order and releases dynamically determined smaller 
chunks of the order to the market using stock-specific historical volume profiles. 

Time-Weighted Average Prices (TWAP): 
This strategy breaks up a large order and releases dynamically determined smaller 
chunks of the order to the market using evenly divided time slots between a start 
and end time.

Percentage of Volume (POV): 
Until the trade order is fully filled, this algorithm continues sending partial 
orders according to the defined participation ratio and according to the volume 
traded in the markets. The related “steps strategy” sends orders at a user-defined 
percentage of market volumes and increases or decreases this participation rate when 
the stock price reaches user-defined levels.

Implementation Shortfall: 
The implementation shortfall strategy aims at minimizing the execution cost of an order 
by trading off the real-time market, thereby saving on the cost of the order and 
benefiting from the opportunity cost of delayed execution. The strategy will increase 
the targeted participation rate when the stock price moves favorably and decrease it when 
the stock price moves adversely.
